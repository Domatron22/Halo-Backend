**Project Scope:** <br/>
  With this project, individuals will be able to access the system for multiple purposes. Medical staff will be able to easily access to create and modify patient records. Many medical establishments have problems communicating between internal departments, and when it comes to communicating between medical establishments or communicating with medical establishments, sometimes it can take a long time to find the data you need. Standards for each medical establishment can be different and therefore some of their systems clash making it hard to communicate. With this system, hospitals from all over the country will be able to log in. <br/>
  Each medical establishment will have its own login, but once on the system, you can look up data that you have been given privilege to look at. There are different access levels that a medical establishment will be able to acquire. Preferable there will be an IT Admin at every site, and they would have the highest clearance, the Doctors and Nurses would have their own levels and so on. Special access can be given to others not in the hospital but registered in the system. Once their level is updated, they will be able to see the data you have sent to them. This will not just be for medical establishments, but it can also be used by the government. There are some jobs in the government that require a medical check like for the military, so now instead of going back to all of your hospitals to get all of your medical data, you would be able to call up administrators of this system to create a new login for whoever is requesting your data and then all of your medical data will be in their hands to analyze appropriately. <br/>
  Medical establishments have all their own forms and these forms change from establishment to establishment. In an ideal world, a board of doctors will get together to find the best form and standardize that form in the system. In this case, the form that is created will have all the necessary data relating to the patient. No more going back to a previous hospital to get more forms filled out, or having hospitals take more time communicating to try and request more data about a specific patient. 

*Purpose:* <br/>
The purpose of the Medical Documentation Information System is to allow the transfer of patient data a fast and easy process. This will include patient to medical professional and medical professional to medical professional.

*Problem at hand:* <br/>
Retrieving data from medical establishments like hospitals can be a hassle. It can take weeks to get a request approved and then more time for medical data to be transferred between entities. On top of that, many medical establishments have forms that are similar to other establishments, but not quite the same, so when medical data is received sometimes data gets lost in translation.

**Goals:** <br/>
The goals of this project are as follows:
-	To create a system that is easy to use
-	To create a system to help individuals access their medical data
-	To create a system that allows transference of medical data with ease
-	To learn more about the process in creating a system
-	To learn more about current hospital systems
-	To create a system that can be put on my resumes

**Significance:** <br/>
  Medical information is very important, and there are some medical establishments that choose to hire entities to create some sort of information system that allows patients to monitor their data, but this is case by case, not every medical establishment has it. Since different entities are hired, the structure of the system changes per case making none of it standardized. This would allow all medical establishments the chance to use an information system that has been standardized allowing not only that standardization of data, but faster transference of data between hospitals.
